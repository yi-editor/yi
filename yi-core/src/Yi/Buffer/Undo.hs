-- | An implementation of restricted, linear undo, as described in:
--
-- >    T. Berlage, "A selective undo mechanism for graphical user interfaces
-- >    based on command objects", ACM Transactions on Computer-Human
-- >    Interaction 1(3), pp. 269-294, 1994.
--
-- Implementation based on a proposal by sjw.
--
-- From Berlage:
--
-- >    All buffer-mutating commands are stored (in abstract form) in an
-- >    Undo list. The most recent item in this list is the action that
-- >    will be undone next. When it is undone, it is removed from the Undo
-- >    list, and its inverse is added to the Redo list. The last command
-- >    put into the Redo list can be redone, and again prepended to the
-- >    Undo list. New commands are added to the Undo list without
-- >    affecting the Redo list.
--
-- Now, the above assumes that commands can be _redone_ in a state other
-- than that in which it was orginally done. This is not the case in our
-- text editor: a user may delete, for example, between an undo and a
-- redo. Berlage addresses this in S2.3. A Yi example:
--
-- >    Delete some characters
-- >    Undo partialy
-- >    Move prior in the file, and delete another _chunk_
-- >    Redo some things  == corruption.
--
-- Berlage describes the /stable execution property/:
--
-- >    A command is always redone in the same state that it was originally
-- >    executed in, and is always undone in the state that was reached
-- >    after the original execution.
--
-- >    The only case where the linear undo model violates the stable
-- >    execution property is when _a new command is submitted while the
-- >    redo list is not empty_. The _restricted linear undo model_ ...
-- >    clears the redo list in this case.
--
-- Also some discussion of this in: /The Text Editor Sam/, Rob Pike, pg 19.
