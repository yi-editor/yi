 * Commandline flag for choosing config directory now works.

   If you want to revive these or make new frontends (Qt, EFL, SDL,
   threepenny-gui, etc), patches are welcome!
 * Test files no longer make case sensitive filesystems mad (issue #458).
 * Yi no longer eats (20 x filesize) memory when opening a file.
